##How to see this locally?
If you are interested in dibbing in my code you can do it, and make it better if you can...

##Clone the repo
You can do that by downloading it ffrom this page or copy and paste the following command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Oussamaosman02/three-village-in-the-universe/
```

For doing that you should have installed git in your pc first!!
##Npm and parcel

For running this in my localhost i used a npm bundler called Parcel.
To can deal with it you have to install first npm:

```bash
sudo apt-get install node
```
Or go to his official website and download it from that

Once node and npm is installed,install parcel en the directory you cloned this repo:

```bash
npm install --save-dev parcel
```
##Ready? Go!!
Once the installation of parcel ends , you need to start a local server provided by parcel:


```bash
npx parcel ./index.html
```

##And enjoy!!!
